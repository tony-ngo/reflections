What is considered big data?
when one machine cannot handle all the data being processed. 
Challenges with big data
- data is created fast
- data from diff sources in various formats

3V's - Volume, Variety, Velocity
- Volume is the amount of data, /size of data
Diff types of data worth storing - transactions, logs business user sensor medical social etc.

- Variety, structured and semi-structured tables that the data fits. 
hadoop stores data in its raw format which can be manipulated later.
ex. variety of data to be stored for an overall purpose, like a truck travelling to a store. 
info like current gps, traffic data, current load, fuel efficiency etc may be useful data. 
Many variables to consider to get large benefits

-Velocity, terabytes per day... we don't want to discard data. 
we can use data for predictions for things like personal interest of users.

------------------------MAPREDUCE---------------------------------------
how is data processed by mapreduce? 
say we have a large file. processing that file serially from top to bottom can take a long time.
mapreduce is designed to process the data in parallel. the file is broken into chucks and processed in parallel.

---------------HADOOP INTRO----------------------------------------------
Hadoop is essentially a kernal for an OS to handle big data.
files are store in HDFS - hadoop distributed file system
process with MapReduce MP.

NAMENODE is the memory block that has all the links for which data blocks in each node belong to which file. 
Each file is divided into 3 data blocks distributed into different nodes (redundant but reduces failure or lost data)
