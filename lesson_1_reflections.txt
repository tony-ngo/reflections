we used "git diff commit_id1 commit id2" to view the differences between two commits and their changes
	- the green + indicates things added while the red - indicates lines removed

a repository is basically all the files that have been commited, including all the previous versions of commits

 a commit will include even files that were not changed, but part of the program, example if you changed a CSS file but not its HTML, they will still both be commits

"git clone" can be used to copy an entire repository in the case you want to copy to a usb or make a backup for example
 --------------------------- TROUBLESHOOTING -------------------------------------
 you can use the version control to go back to older commits before there were bugs 
 use the command "git checkout commit_id" to set the "current version" to be the commit of your choice.
 to revert back to having the "current version" as your most recent commit, use the same command but with the latest commit ID
